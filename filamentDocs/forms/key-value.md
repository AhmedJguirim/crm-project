# Key-value 

## [#](#introduction)Introduction

The key-value field allows you to interact with one-dimensional JSON object:

 use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;
 
 KeyValue::make('meta')

![Key-value](/docs/4.x/images/light/forms/fields/key-value/simple.jpg) ![Key-value](/docs/4.x/images/dark/forms/fields/key-value/simple.jpg)

If you’re saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

 use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 
 class Post extends Model
 {
 /**
 * @return array<string, string>
 */
 protected function casts(): array
 { 
 return [
 'meta' => 'array',
 ];
 }
 
 // ...
 }

## [#](#adding-rows)Adding rows

An action button is displayed below the field to allow the user to add a new row.

## [#](#setting-the-add-action-buttons-label)Setting the add action button’s label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a row, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

 use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;
 
 KeyValue::make('meta')
 ->addActionLabel('Add property')

As well as allowing a static value, the `addActionLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

## [#](#customizing-the-key-value-action-objects)Customizing the key-value action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

 * `addAction()`
 * `deleteAction()`
 * `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

 use Filament\Actions\Action;
 use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;
 use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
 
 KeyValue::make('meta')
 ->deleteAction(
 fn (Action $action) => $action->icon(Heroicon::XMark),
 )

The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters. [ Learn more about utility injection. ](/docs/4.x/forms/overview#field-utility-injection) Utility | Type | Parameter | Description
