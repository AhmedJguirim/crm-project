Actions 

# Replicate action 

## [#](#introduction)Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to [replicate](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#replicating-models) Eloquent records. You may use it like so:

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()

## [#](#excluding-attributes)Excluding attributes

The `excludeAttributes()` method is used to instruct the action which columns should be excluded from replication:

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->excludeAttributes(['slug'])

## [#](#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form)Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
 $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();
 
 return $data;
 })

## [#](#redirecting-after-replication)Redirecting after replication

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))

As well as `$record`, the `successRedirectUrl()` function can inject various utilities as parameters. [ Learn more about utility injection. ](/docs/4.x/actions/overview#action-utility-injection) Utility | Type | Parameter | Description 
---|---|---|--- 
Action | `Filament\Actions\Action` | `$action` | The current action instance. 
Arguments | `array<string, mixed>` | `$arguments` | The array of arguments passed to the action when it was triggered.

## [#](#customizing-the-replicate-notification)Customizing the replicate notification

When the record is successfully replicated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->successNotificationTitle('Category replicated')

As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

 ->body('The category has been replicated successfully.'),
 )

As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

## [#](#lifecycle-hooks)Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action’s lifecycle, like before the replica is saved.

 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->before(function () {
 // Runs before the record has been replicated.
 })
 ->beforeReplicaSaved(function (Model $replica): void {
 // Runs after the record has been replicated but before it is saved to the database.
 })
 ->after(function (Model $replica): void {
 // Runs after the replica has been saved to the database.
 })

These hook functions can inject various utilities as parameters. [ Learn more about utility injection. ](/docs/4.x/actions/overview#action-utility-injection) Utility | Type | Parameter | Description 
---|---|---|---

## [#](#halting-the-replication-process)Halting the replication process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook, which will halt the entire replication process:

 use App\Models\Post;
 use Filament\Actions\Action;
 use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
 use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
 
 ReplicateAction::make()
 ->before(function (ReplicateAction $action, Post $record) {
 if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
 Notification::make()
 ->warning()
 ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
 ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
 ->persistent()
 ->actions([
 Action::make('subscribe')
 ->button()
 ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
 ])
 ->send();
 
 $action->halt();
 }
 })

If you’d like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

 $action->cancel();
